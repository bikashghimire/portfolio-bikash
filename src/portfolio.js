      "At Metso, I led the development of scalable design system UI libraries, including a React-based framework and a framework-agnostic web components library, collectively achieving 100,000+ npm downloads. I ensured components were reusable, accessible, and performance-optimized, adhering to WCAG standards and collaborating with cross-functional teams. My work on the design system earned recognition at the Metso Innovation Award 2024 for its impact on UI/UX standardization and scalability. Additionally, I developed AI-driven solutions in Azure using OpenAI Studio, integrated CI/CD workflows, and deployed static web applications.",
